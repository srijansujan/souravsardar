<p align="justify"> Sourav’s family lost their house in the infamous cyclone Aila, in 2009. Originally from Sandeshkhali in North 24 Parganas, Sourav had to endure extreme poverty all his life. Nevertheless, he passed his H.S Examinations and made it to Jadavpur University in 2012 to study physics. But due to severe financial crises, Sourav was forced to quit and left the university hostel to work as a labourer at a construction site in Beleghata, Kolkata, some time in 2014. His ailing father cannot work and his mother is suffering from certain mental disorder. His sister is the only earning member, giving private tuitions, which is not enough to support the family of six. Hence, Sourav was left with no choice but to look for any possible work he could find. Fortunately, some members of Srijan Sujan came to know about Sourav’s ordeal and brought him back to the University in 2015. He has resolved to concentrate on his studies now and finish his bachelor’s first.</p>
